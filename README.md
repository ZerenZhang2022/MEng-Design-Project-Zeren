# MEng Design Project-Zeren
 Repository for ECE6930

I haven't install matlab on my laptop yet (will do that soon), so I upload the confusion matrix as a txt file.

By the way, for parameters, do I need to upload ResNet structure? Or what is required for parameters?

The files for vgg16 will be uploaded this afternoon (11/22)
